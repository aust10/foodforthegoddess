# Beyond
Beyond this project length I plan to keep working on this site adding more functionality and features along with implementing art displays into the mix. 

- Add talk function to allow recipe to talk to you out loud so you don't have to touch your device with dirty hands.
- Add links to tools needed to accomplish recipes with *Amazon*.
- Add Art display feature to page to showcase unique homemade art.
- Make it IOS compatable.

This site has endless possibilities and I really want to give the average user the best experience!
